# LETS: Language Enable Task Synthesizer 

A speech enabled task automator.

## Description

Not even Alpha yet, may be refactored many times over! A task manager that interprets common conversation requets and creates an inferred task request.  For example "Let's set up a new visual studio code document for a python project for automating browser interactions"  will automate the creation of project instances, downloading of pip packages, and staging of document.
